    <h2 id="article_description">Persistence Partners Co-Founder Invests in the Future of School-Based Enterprise</h2>
        <p class="article_story"><b>Camarillo CA – April 18th, 2017</b>– RCMAKES, a student-operated business
          at Rancho Campana High School, is launching with $250,000 in startup funding from
          engineer, entrepreneur and venture capitalist Dave Gross and his wife, Dawn Gross,
          Braille Manager at the Alternate Text Production Center. Mr. Gross currently teaches
          engineering and business classes offered at Rancho Campana through a partnership
          with the Ventura County Office of Education and Oxnard Union High School District.
          Mr.Gross will volunteer as general manager of the new venture.</p><br/>
        <p class="article_story">“We are providing entrepreneurial experiences in a mentor-apprentice environment
          with genuine private-sector responsibility, accountability and pride-of-ownership,“ says
          Gross. “The student-managed Community Makerspace, Retail Store and Job Shop introduce
          students to local businesses and develop real-world skills. Students experience the latest
          technologies for engineering, manufacturing and business management.”</p><br/>
        <p class="article_story">RCMAKES evolved from two years of collaborative planning and volunteer work
            at the new academy high school, where project-based learning and work-based learning
            are integral to the curriculum. All students at the school are encouraged to intern in
            their senior year. “Applying both academic learning with hands-on technical skills leads
            to more meaningful internships,” continues Gross. “The students are building a startup
            company from the ground up. They address all of the diverse aspects of that real-world
            challenge while simultaneously gaining specific career-path experience.”</p><br/>
          <p class="article_story">Roger Adams, Principal at Rancho shared with us, “The addition of an agile, self-funded,
              independent organization allows spending flexibility and speed of execution that enhances
              our mission to provide meaningful work-based learning opportunities to our students.
              RCMAKES is a pathway accelerator that helps prepare for post-secondary study and
              a career in any field.”</p>
