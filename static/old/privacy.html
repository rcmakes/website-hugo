        <p class="policy_info">This privacy policy has been compiled to better
serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information'
(PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information
security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to
identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in
context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding
of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable
Information in accordance with our website.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">What personal information do we collect from

            </ul><br/>

in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible. Your personal information
is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number
of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep

of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their
information to maintain the safety of your personal information. All transactions
are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">Do we use 'cookies'?</b><br/>Yes. Cookies are
small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard
drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service
provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your
shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on
previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved
services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic
and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">We use cookies to:</b><br/></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="point">- Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.</li><br/>
                <li class="point">- Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.</li><br/>
                <li class="point">- Compile aggregate data about site traffic and
site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
        <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each
time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this

browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">If users disable cookies in their browser:</b><br/>If
you turn cookies off, some of the features that make your site experience more
efficient may not function properly. Some of the features that make your site
experience more efficient may not function properly.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">Third-party disclosure</b><br/>We do not sell,
trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information
unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting
partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our
business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information
confidential. We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to
comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights,
property or safety.</p>
<p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information
may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">Third-party links</b><br/>Occasionally, at our
discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website.
These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore
have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked
sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any
feedback about these sites.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">California Online Privacy Protection Act</b><br/>CalOPPA
is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services
to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require
any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates
websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers
to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information
being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

        <p><b class="policy_st">According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</b><br/>Users
can visit our site anonymously.<br/> Once this privacy policy is created, we will
add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page
after entering our website.<br/> Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy'
and can easily be found on the page specified above. You will be notified of any
Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page. You can change your personal
information by logging in to your account.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b><br/>When
it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of
13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in
control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency,
enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically
market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">Fair Information Practices</b><br/>The Fair Information
Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and
the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of
data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
privacy laws that protect personal information.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices
we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</b><br/>We
will notify you via email within 7 business days. We also agree to the Individual
Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue
enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to
the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government
agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">CAN SPAM Act</b><br/>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law
that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them,
and spells out tough penalties for violations</p><br/>
        <p><b class="policy_st">We collect your email address in order to:</b><br/></p>
