            <ol class="equipment_guideline_list">
              <li>1. Set the Speed: The speed on this drill press is adjusted by moving the drive belt from one pulley to another. In general, the smaller the pulley on the chuck axis, the faster it spins. A rule of thumb, as with any cutting operation, is that slower speeds are better for drilling metal, faster speeds for wood.</li>
              <li>2. Fit the Bit: Open the chuck, slide in the bit, snug the chuck by hand around the bit’s shaft, then tighten the chuck’s three jaws with the key. Make sure to remove the key.  If you don’t, it’ll become a dangerous projectile when you turn on the drill.</li>
              <li>3. Adjust the Table: This model has a crank that adjusts the table height. Set the table to the desired height for the operation you are to perform.</li>
              <li>4. Gauging the Depth. Start by lowering the bit to the desired height, and ad­just the pair of knurled nuts on the depth gauge to the proper stopping point. One of them should stop the spindle; the other locks the first nut in place.</li>
              <li>5. Secure the Workpiece. Before operating your drill press, be sure that the workpiece to be drilled is fixed in place. The ro­tation of the drill bit may try to spin the wood or metal workpiece, so it must be clamped to the worktable. Never operate the tool without firmly anchoring the workpiece.</li>
              <li>6. Drilling. Once the drill press setup has been completed, put­ting it to work is easy. Make sure the drill is spinning at full speed, then present the to the workpiece, lowering the bit by rotating the lever. Once you’ve finished drilling the hole, release the pressure on the lever and its spring-loaded return mechanism will return it to its original position.</li>

                <ol class="equipment_guideline_list">
                  <li>1. First, make sure you are following Makerspace safety precautions (tie back hair, no loose clothing, protective eye-wear and closed-toe shoes).</li>
                  <li>2. Use a clamp to prevent workpiece from spinning</li>
                  <li>3. Insert your desired bit into the drill chuck and then tighten it.</li>
                  <li>4. Use a vacuum, brush, or rake to remove cuttings.</li>
                  <li>5. Do not touch cuttings with hands because they are hot. </li>
                  <li>6. Frequently raise drill bit to clean cuttings when drilling a deep hole</li>
                  <li>7. Reduce drill pressure when it begins to go through the piece. </li>
