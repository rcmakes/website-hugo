##### Safety Guidelines:
1. First, make sure you are following Makerspace safety precautions (tie back       hair, no loose clothing, and closed-toe shoes).

2. Wear a full-face protective mask and do not wear gloves.

3. Be sure people around you are at a safe distance from the saw.

4. Keep protective guards in place at all times

5. Make sure that the blade is the proper size and shape for the arbor hole.        Additionally, check that there is no buildup on the blade.

6. Place piece of wood flat up against the fence. Hold one side of the wood to      prevent it from moving at least six inches away from the blade.

7. Be careful to not push wood into the blade. If using a small piece of wood,      make sure there are clamps to keep it in place.

8. Make sure saw is at full speed before making the cut.

9. Don’t raise blade from workpiece until blade has come to a complete stop.
