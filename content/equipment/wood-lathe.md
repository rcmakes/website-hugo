##### How to Use:
1. Find the center of the wood (ex: by using the centering tool, or by drawing      lines from corner to corner, and using the x-point).

2. Put tool stand just under the middle of the wood, to allow the tool to make      the best contact.

3. For using the gouge RPM should be 800 to 1000.

4. For the skew and other tools turn the speed up to between 1,000 and 1,200.

5. For sanding and polishing, turn the speed up to at least 1800 rpm6. Hold the     tools with the point facing up and the handle down at a slight angle, if you      don’t, it will catch in between the wood and the support.

##### Safety Guidelines:
1. Follow all shop rules.

2. When using the lathe, a full-face shield is used instead of goggles. This        shield MUST be worn AT ALL TIMES when the lathe is on.

3. Make sure everyone without a face shield is at a safe distance before turning    on the lathe.

4. Keep your tools sharpened, dull tools can cause injuries (to sharpen tools, do   not use grinder, use the sharpening stone).

5. Do not use standard 2 by 4’s, or plywood, this wood is brittle, and will         splinter, and can cause injuries.

6. Always keep a firm grip on your tools.

7. Never use a tool with only 1 hand.

8. If your name is not on the list of people approved to use the lathe, you must    have someone who is approved there to watch you.

9. Never leave the lathe on when unattended.

10. Be confidant! If you are not confidant you can end up injuring yourself or      others.
