##### Safety Guidelines:
###### Lathe Saftety
1. Always wear eye protection!

2. The three-jaw chuck is very dangerous. Make sure that the workpiece is sufficiently tight. 

3. Be sure to remove the chuck wrench before turning the machine on or else it will be thrown.

4. Do not have loose hair, clothing or jewelry near the lathe while it is on.

5. Do not wear anything on your hands or wrists or they may get caught.

6. Do not to not get close to the chuck as there are many sharp edges spinning at high speeds.

7. Make sure to have the machine turned in the appropriate direction while cutting.

8. Be sure to not turn on the machine while making adjustments.

9. Never adjust anything while the lathe is still spinning.

10. Be sure that the tool bit is securely fastened in the tool post before attempting to cut anything. 

11. Adjust height of the tool bit so it is cutting at the center of the workpiece when machine is off.

12. Do not make too big of a cut as it may damage the machine or result in the piece being thrown.

13. Do not allow the tool bit to crash into the chuck.

14. Shavings may be sharp and can cut.

##### Mill Saftety
1. Always wear eye protection.

2. Do not wear long sleeves, loose jewelry, or have dangling hair.

3. Always unplug the machine when adjusting the belt speeds.

4. Make sure that the workpiece is clamped securely.

5. Be careful when putting the cutter in the collet as it is very sharp.

6. Fully tighten the cutter before using the machine.

7. Ensure that the machine is running in the forward (or backward) direction as necessary.

8. Do not touch the tool bit while it is spinning or when it is stopped as it's very sharp and can cut.

9. Avoid touching the shavings as they are very sharp.

10. Always clean up the area after use.

11. Do not leave lubricant or oil on the ground, especially next to the welder.

##### How to Use:
###### Mill Operation
1. Check the area for hazards and clear any debris. 

2. Select the proper speed for the type of cut by adjusting the belts. **Always unplug the machine before adjusting     belt speeds** The appropriate speed will depend on which material is being cut, the desired finish, and the tool     bit. Refer to online resources such as this: TooLingu.

3. Select the appropriate tool bit and corresponding collet for the task at hand: cnccookbook.

4. Place the tool bit in the collet by threading the guide pin on the shank into the appropriate hole, tightening the nut, and replacing the cap.

5. Place the workpiece on the main platform using a rest. Ensure that it is at the appropriate height by testing the movement when the mill is off. 

6. When cutting with the mill, use cutting lubricant to avoid excess heat and provide a smoother finish. 

7. Test out movements before turning the mill on to avoid accidental contact with anything that is not the workpiece. 

8. For work involving detailed specifications, set the gauges on the tool rest to zero in order to calculate the distance of a cut from the starting point and the depth of cut. 

9. Clear away shavings using one of the provided brushes when the mill is turned off. Do not touch metal shavings with bare hands as they present a cutting hazard. Do not make any adjustments while the machine is still moving. 

10. After having finished making all cuts, clean up the workspace completely.

##### Lathe Operation
1. Check the area for hazards and clear anything in the workspace. 

2. Select the appropriate speed for the material being cut by referring to online resources such as this: TooLingu      **Always unplug the machine before adjusting belt speeds** 

3. Select the proper tool bit for the task being accomplished. Reference this webpage to select the appropriate tool:AmericaMachineTools 

4. Put the cutting implement into the holder and tighten so that the shank is firmly locked in place and the cutting    edge is the only part of the tool coming in contact with the stock, ensuring that all bolts are sufficiently         fastened.

5. Select workpiece and fasten in the chuck using the provided key. **DO NOT TURN THE MACHINE ON WITH THE KEY IN THE CHUCK**

6. Before turning the lathe on, take a few practice passes on the equipment to check for accidental contact with        other parts of the machine. Contact with the workpiece, chuck, or tool rest may damage the machine and possibly      cause injury. 

7. Prime the stop button, and turn on the power before turning on the lathe. When turning on the lathe, set the speed to forward.

8. Make the cuts as intended, being sure to only take off small amounts of material per pass, especially when turning metal. 

9. For work involving detailed specifications, set the gauges on the tool rest to zero in order to calculate the distance of a cut from the starting point and the depth of cut. 

10. Always have cutting fluid available and apply frequently to ensure smoother cuts and avoid overheating the stock or tool bit.

11. Clear away shavings from work area as needed by turning off the machine and using one of the brushes provided. Do not touch metal shavings! They are sharp and may cut you.

12. Never adjust the workpiece without turning the lathe off and allowing it to come to a complete stop. This includes adjusting the workpiece in the chuck, clearing away shavings, and taking measurements.

13. After having completely finished turning a workpiece, turn the machine off, 
put the tool bit away, and clean up the area completely by removing shavings with a dustpan and brush. Put any other equipment back where you found it.
